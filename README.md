# Climbing Centers Analysis

This project aims to analyze the distribution of climbing centers in Spain using geographical and socioeconomic data. The analysis incorporates data from OpenStreetMap and population density data to understand the adequacy of climbing centers in various regions.

## Background

The project began as an exploration of whether there are sufficient climbing centers in Spain, inspired by a friend's comment. Over the course of three years, the project evolved to include detailed geographical and socioeconomic analysis. The final analysis utilizes open-source GIS tools and data from Kaggle and OpenStreetMap.

## Methods and Data

- **Data Collection:** Population density data from Kaggle and climbing center data from OpenStreetMap.
- **Data Preparation:** Conversion of JSON data to geopandas dataframes and spatial joining with population density data.
- **Analysis:** Calculation of climbing center distribution using Python libraries (`geopandas`, `folium`, and `overpy`).

## Results

The project visualizes the distribution of climbing centers in Spain and evaluates whether the existing centers meet the population's needs. The results highlight regions with potential gaps in climbing center availability.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
