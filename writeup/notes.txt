Certainly! Coordinate reference systems (CRS) are indeed one type of coordinate system used in maps. Here are some other types of coordinate systems commonly used in mapping:

1. **Geographic Coordinates**: This system uses latitude and longitude to specify a location on the Earth's surface. Latitude measures the distance north or south of the equator, while longitude measures the distance east or west of the prime meridian.

2. **UTM (Universal Transverse Mercator)**: UTM divides the Earth into a series of zones, each with its own coordinate system. It's commonly used for large-scale mapping and navigation, particularly in military applications.

3. **State Plane Coordinates**: This system is used in the United States and divides the country into over 120 zones, each with its own coordinate system optimized for accuracy within that region.

4. **Grid Coordinates**: Grid coordinates divide a map into a grid system, often using letters and numbers to specify locations within the grid. Military grids like the Military Grid Reference System (MGRS) are examples of this type.

5. **Mercator Projection Coordinates**: Mercator projection is a cylindrical map projection that preserves angles and shapes, but not areas. It's commonly used for navigation charts and maps of regions far from the equator.

6. **Polar Coordinates**: Polar coordinates specify locations based on distance from a reference point (often the pole) and an angle relative to a reference direction (usually north).

These are just a few examples, and there are many other coordinate systems used in mapping, each with its own advantages and applications.
